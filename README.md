Dev work on Web Extensions for Firefox, Chrome, and Brave. 

## Query Params Remover
### Browser extension to remove fbclid and utm_ query params from URLs before they load.
FBclid - Facebook Click Identifier.
utm - Urchin Tracking Module. 

For now, the full list of query params that get stripped out of URLs are "fbclid", "utm_source", "utm_medium", "utm_campaign", "utm_term", "utm_content", "utm_brand", "\_\_cft\_\_[0]" and "\_\_tn\_\_".

## Hide Fixed Elements
### Adds a button which can be clicked to make "fixed" elements (that is, headers/footers/sidebars that stay stuck to one part of the window) disappear, opening up more space to view the page content.
This is not my code. I just wanted to host this code so I can refer back to it.
